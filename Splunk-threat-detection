# 🔍 Splunk Threat Detection Exercises

This folder includes notes and practice logs related to threat detection using Splunk. These exercises helped me explore real-world detection methods used by SOC teams and Blue Team analysts.

---

## 🛠️ Tools Used
- Splunk Enterprise (local instance)
- Sample data logs (syslog, authentication logs, malware traffic samples)

---

## 🧪 Detection Techniques Practiced
- **Brute-force attack detection**: Using failed login attempts over a short window of time
- **Suspicious PowerShell usage**: Identifying Base64 encoded scripts in command-line logs
- **Port scanning activity**: Flagging repeated access to multiple ports by the same source
- **DNS tunneling**: Monitoring DNS requests for suspicious or encoded patterns

## 📊 Sample SPL Queries

```spl
index=main sourcetype=WinEventLog:Security EventCode=4625
