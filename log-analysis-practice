# 📝 Log Analysis Practice

This section contains notes and practical exercises for analyzing system and security logs across various Linux environments. I used tools like `journalctl`, `grep`, `awk`, and custom scripts to understand patterns and uncover anomalies.

---

## 🔧 Tools Used
- Ubuntu (WSL and VirtualBox)
- `journalctl`, `auth.log`, `syslog`
- `grep`, `awk`, `cut`, `sed`
- Python for custom log parsing

---

## 🔍 Logs Analyzed

### 1. **auth.log**
- Detected failed SSH login attempts
- Identified sudo activity by specific users
- Tracked privilege escalation events

### 2. **syslog**
- Filtered for system reboots and kernel messages
- Reviewed startup service failures
- Captured USB insert/remove logs

### 3. **journalctl**
- Used flags like `--since`, `--until`, `-u ssh`, and `-p err` to filter logs
- Exported results to text files for deeper inspection

## 📑 Example Commands

```bash
# Find failed SSH logins
grep "Failed password" /var/log/auth.log | awk '{print $1, $2, $3, $11, $13}'

# Show logs for the SSH service
journalctl -u ssh --since "1 hour ago"

# List all sudo usage
grep 'sudo' /var/log/auth.log | cut -d':' -f4-
