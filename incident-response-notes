# 🛡️ Incident Response Notes

This file contains essential notes and practical steps for handling cybersecurity incidents, particularly on Linux systems. It outlines the initial response, triage, containment, and forensic steps relevant for Blue Team operations.

## 🔍 Initial Triage & Detection

1. **Identify the Indicator of Compromise (IOC)**:
   - Suspicious login attempts
   - Unexpected running processes
   - High CPU/network usage

2. **Check for User Login Anomalies**:
   ```bash
   last -a | head
   who
   w
   ```

3. **Process Inspection**:
   ```bash
   ps aux --sort=-%cpu | head
   top
   ```

4. **Network Connections**:
   ```bash
   netstat -tulpn
   ss -tuna
   lsof -i
   ```

## 🧯 Containment Steps

1. **Isolate the Host**:
   - Remove from network (if necessary)
   - Limit access via firewall

2. **Stop Malicious Processes**:
   ```bash
   kill -9 <PID>
   ```

3. **Audit Running Services**:
   ```bash
   systemctl list-units --type=service
   chkconfig --list
   ```

---

## 📝 Log Collection

1. **Authentication Logs**:
   ```bash
   cat /var/log/auth.log | grep "Failed"
   cat /var/log/secure
   ```

2. **System Logs**:
   ```bash
   dmesg
   journalctl -xe
   ```

3. **Copy logs for investigation**:
   ```bash
   cp /var/log/*.log /home/forensics/logs/
   ```

---

## 🔎 Forensics

1. **Hashing files for evidence integrity**:
   ```bash
   sha256sum suspicious_file
   ```

2. **Audit system changes**:
   ```bash
   ausearch -x bash
   aureport --auth
   ```

3. **Memory capture** (if supported):
   Use tools like `LiME` or `volatility` on captured dumps.

## ✅ Final Notes

- Always maintain chain-of-custody for evidence.
- Record all actions taken.
- Report and document the timeline.

🧠 *Review regularly. Stay ready. Incident response is about preparation as much as reaction.*
