### 🧠 Cyber Lab Exercises

A hands-on repository showcasing my exploration of cybersecurity fundamentals. These exercises demonstrate practical knowledge in system hardening, log analysis, basic threat detection, and Blue Team operations using widely adopted tools and commands.

---

### 🛠 Topics Covered

- 🔐 Linux system hardening and user auditing  
- 📊 Log parsing and analysis (auth.log, syslog, journalctl)  
- 🧩 File integrity monitoring (AuditD, AIDE)  
- 🚨 Intrusion detection concepts (e.g., Fail2Ban configuration)  
- 📡 Network reconnaissance defense and firewall configuration (UFW, iptables)  
- 🛑 Malware triage and response basics  
- 📁 File permissions and sudo privilege reviews  

---

### 🧪 Tools & Platforms Used

- Ubuntu/Linux via WSL and VirtualBox  
- Bash scripting and PowerShell basics  
- AuditD, UFW, syslog, logrotate  
- Splunk and Elastic Stack (introduced, planned for expansion)  
- Wireshark and tcpdump for packet analysis

### 💻 Sample Exercises & Concepts

| Exercise | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `audit_file_integrity.sh` | Bash script using AuditD to monitor system file changes |
| `user_audit_report` | Lists all sudo users, login activity, and idle accounts |
| `ufw_firewall_rules` | Secures SSH and blocks common ports with UFW |
| `auth_log_parser.py` | Python script to scan and summarize failed logins |
| `nmap_scan_detect` | Configures iptables and Fail2Ban to detect and block port scans |
